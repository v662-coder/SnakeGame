## Getting Started

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:<your-user-name>/snakes-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd snake-game
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. Yarn is recommended:

   ```shell
   yarn
   ```

4. Run the build script:

   ```shell
   yarn build
   ```

5. Start the game by serving the build output:

   ```shell
   yarn preview
   ```

**NOTE**: The development environment causes the components to re-render, causing the game logic for the canvas to be duplicated and appear buggy. That's why it's recommended to build the app and run the build output to avoid the re-renders.

## Game Controls

Use the arrow keys or `W`,`A`,`S`,`D` keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction:

- ‚Üë (Up) or `W` - Move Up
- ‚Üì (Down) or `S` - Move Down
- ‚Üê (Left) or `A` - Move Left
- ‚Üí (Right) or `D` - Move Right
